      <description>About
  Hetco was commissioned by the Public Engagement department at Wellcome Trust to conduct a research review project, that enhances the findings of the first Wellcome Global Monitor 2018 to reveal and prompt meaningful opportunities for research for teams within Wellcome. We identified patterns within the dataset, and worked with Studio Ala and Smithery to help communicate the complexity of the findings.
The resulting lenses of Religion, Societal Institutions, Benefits and Future Economies are designed to help scientists, programme managers and policy-makers consider trust in science from different points of view.</description>

      <description>Benefits  1 in 5 people feel personally excluded from the benefits of science.

      <description>Future Economies  As economies evolve, they may become more likely to trust that scientists provide accurate information and more skeptical of science’s ability to increase jobs.

			<p class="subtext">How an uncomplicated relationship lead to a positive cross-referral system for mental health in Ghana;</p>
			<p>The health-care system supporting mental health in Ghana appears to have evolved into a collaboration between Western clinicians and traditional African and Western religious healers. These interactions consist of a ‘cross-referral system’, which is, however, largely unofficial. A pastor told the Ae-Ngibise et al. (2010) that he normally referred his patients to the hospital first, before asking them to fast and pray. A Muslim healer also said that he referred patients to the hospital if he had tried all other possible methods and the ailment persisted. In addition, a health programme director reported the need for a relationship between clinicians and faith-based healers, since he had seen successful management in cases in which the church encouraged patients</p>

			during the Oral Polio Vaccination campaigns in Nigeria;</p>
			<p>In northern Nigeria in 2003, the political and religious leaders of Kano, Zamfara, and Kaduna states brought the immunization campaign to a halt by calling on parents not to allow their children to be immunized. These leaders argued that the vaccine could be contaminated with antifertility agents (estradiol hormone), HIV, and cancerous agents. This impasse was eventually resolved in July 2004 through dialogue, with religious leaders playing a significant role in the process.</p> 
			<p>In September 2006, the WHO Regional Committee for Africa stated that “the number of confirmed polio cases in northern Nigeria more than doubled in the first five months of 2006 as compared to the same period in 2005” and that in 2006 Nigeria accounted for over 80% of the global polio burden”</p>

			<p class="subtext">How the cultural authority of science plunged and then was empowered by religion during the Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa;</p>
			<p>At the beginning of the Ebola outbreak, pastors were laying their hands on the sick to cure them of ‘spiritual attacks’. A leader told pastors that all those who fasted for 100 days should have no fear of Ebola but that they should avoid laying their hands on the sick. The traditional practices of sitting on mats to mourn the dead and washing their bodies by Bassonians, Kru and Grebo people brought the uninfected into contact with the virus.</p> 

			<p>Subsequently, Many churches ordered the suspension of the practice of shaking hands as a sign of peace and the serving of Holy Communion directly to the mouth. There were also calls for the suspension of traditional practices of mourning the dead. Churches became a source of medical aid and health communication.</p>
